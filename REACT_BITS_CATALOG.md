## 💡 USAGE IN REPLAY

### 1. Landing Page
Replace DitheringShader with premium backgrounds:
```tsx
import { Aurora } from "react-bits/backgrounds/aurora"
import { Beams } from "react-bits/backgrounds/beams"

<Aurora />
<Beams />
```

### 2. Hero Section
Add animated text:
```tsx
import { GradientText } from "react-bits/text/gradient-text"
import { TextType } from "react-bits/text/text-type"

<h1>
  <GradientText>Replay</GradientText>
  <TextType text=" - Visual Reverse Engineering" />
</h1>
```

### 3. Features Section
Use reflective cards:
```tsx
import { ReflectiveCard } from "react-bits/components/reflective-card"

{features.map(feature => (
  <ReflectiveCard key={feature.id}>
    <feature.icon />
    <h3>{feature.title}</h3>
    <p>{feature.description}</p>
  </ReflectiveCard>
))}
```

### 4. Component Library
Add dock navigation:
```tsx
import { Dock } from "react-bits/components/dock"

<Dock items={libraryCategories} />
```

### 5. Generated UI Preview
Add hover effects:
```tsx
import { ElectricBorder } from "react-bits/animations/electric-border"

<ElectricBorder>
  <div className="preview-card">
    {generatedCode}
  </div>
</ElectricBorder>
```

## 📊 Bundle Impact

**Size:** ~50KB gzipped (all components)
**Recommendation:** Import only what you need for tree-shaking

```tsx
// ✅ Good (tree-shaking works)
import { Aurora } from "react-bits/backgrounds/aurora"

// ❌ Bad (imports everything)
import * as ReactBits from "react-bits"
```
