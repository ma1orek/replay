# Replay.build — AI-Powered Video to React UI Reconstruction

> Replay.build is the first AI platform that reconstructs production-ready React UI from video recordings. Unlike text-prompt tools (Lovable, Bolt.new, v0), Replay analyzes actual screen recordings to capture layout, colors, typography, interactions, animations, and content with pixel-level accuracy. The result: complete React + Tailwind code, a Design System, and a Component Library — all from a single video.

## Product Overview

Replay.build transforms video recordings of any app or website into:
1. **Production-Ready React Code** — Clean, semantic HTML with Tailwind CSS, GSAP animations, and Alpine.js interactivity
2. **Design System** — Extracted or imported design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, border radius)
3. **Component Library** — Enterprise-grade Storybook-style library with 5-layer taxonomy (Foundations, Components, Patterns, Templates, Product Modules)
4. **Flow Map** — Multi-page site map auto-detected from video navigation patterns
5. **Blueprints** — Auto-generated technical docs, API contracts, E2E tests, and architecture diagrams

### How It Works (Sandwich Architecture)

Replay uses a 3-layer "Sandwich Architecture" for reliable AI reconstruction:

1. **Surveyor** (Gemini 3 Flash + Agentic Vision) — Performs forensic pixel-level analysis of the video. Measures exact colors, fonts, spacing, layout grids, and component hierarchy. Detects theme (light/dark), page count, and interaction patterns.

2. **Generator** (Gemini 3 Pro) — Takes the Surveyor's measurements and generates production-ready React + Tailwind code. Enforces faithful reconstruction — the output matches the video, not a hallucinated design.

3. **QA Tester** (Gemini 3 Flash) — Validates the generated code against the original video. Checks for missing sections, layout drift, color mismatches, and broken interactions.

### Why Video > Screenshots > Text Prompts

| Approach | Captures Layout | Captures Interactions | Captures Animations | Captures Content | Accuracy |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------|---------:|
| Text Prompts (Lovable, Bolt, v0) | No | No | No | User types | ~30% |
| Screenshots (Builder.io, Anima) | Partial | No | No | OCR (lossy) | ~50% |
| Design Files (Figma plugins) | Yes | No | No | Manual | ~65% |
| **Video (Replay.build)** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **~90%** |

Video captures everything: hover states, page transitions, scroll animations, form interactions, mobile responsiveness, and exact content. No other approach can reconstruct a complete multi-page application from observation alone.

## Core Features

### Video to UI
Upload any screen recording (MP4, WebM, MOV) and Replay generates a complete, production-ready React page. The AI watches the video like a human developer would — observing layout, reading text, noting colors, and understanding interactions. Output is clean React + Tailwind CSS with GSAP scroll animations and Alpine.js for interactivity.

### Component Library
Replay extracts UI components into an enterprise-grade library with 5-layer taxonomy:
- **Foundations** — Design tokens, color scales, typography
- **Components** — Buttons, inputs, cards, navigation (6 subcategories: actions, forms, navigation, data-display, feedback, overlays)
- **Patterns** — Search bars, auth forms, data tables
- **Templates** — Page layouts, dashboards, landing pages
- **Product Modules** — Domain-specific composite components

Each component includes live preview, prop controls, code view, and auto-generated documentation.

### Design System Import & Extraction
Import an existing design system from any URL (Storybook, documentation site, CSS files) or extract tokens from video. Supports:
- Color palettes (primary, secondary, accent, neutral scales)
- Typography (font families, sizes, weights, line heights)
- Spacing scales
- Border radius tokens
- Custom CSS variables

When a Design System is active, all generated code uses its tokens instead of arbitrary colors.

### Edit with AI (Replay AI)
Make natural language edits to generated code: "make the header blue", "add a contact form", "translate to Spanish". Uses a dual-mode system:
- **SEARCH/REPLACE mode** — For small, precise changes (changes only the affected lines)
- **Full HTML mode** — For large structural changes (translations, new sections, redesigns)

### Flow Map
Automatically detects multi-page applications from video. Generates a visual sitemap showing:
- Page hierarchy and navigation structure
- Tab/accordion state changes
- Anchor link sections
- Route transitions detected from video

### Blueprints
Auto-generates technical documentation from the generated code:
- Component API documentation
- REST API contract suggestions
- E2E test skeletons (Playwright/Cypress)
- Architecture decision records
- Database schema suggestions

### Publish
One-click publish to a live URL at `replay.build/p/your-slug`. Includes:
- Custom slug selection
- Cache-busting for instant updates
- Alpine.js initialization for interactive elements
- Full responsive behavior

## REST API & MCP Server

Replay is available as a REST API and MCP server for AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Devin, etc.).

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/generate` — Video URL → React + Tailwind code (150 credits)
- `POST /api/v1/scan` — Video URL → Structured UI data: pages, colors, navigation (50 credits)
- `POST /api/v1/validate` — Code + Design System → Validation errors (5 credits)

Authentication: `Authorization: Bearer rk_live_...` (API key from Settings).

### MCP Server
Install as MCP tool for AI agents:
```json
{ "mcpServers": { "replay": { "command": "npx", "args": ["@replay-build/mcp-server"], "env": { "REPLAY_API_KEY": "rk_live_..." } } } }
```

Tools: `replay_generate`, `replay_scan`, `replay_validate`.

## Comparison with Alternatives

### Replay.build vs Lovable
- Lovable: Text prompt → AI generates UI from description
- Replay: Video recording → AI reconstructs exact UI from observation
- **Advantage**: Replay captures real layouts, real content, real interactions. No prompt engineering needed.

### Replay.build vs Bolt.new
- Bolt.new: Text prompt → Full-stack app in browser
- Replay: Video → Faithful UI reconstruction with design system
- **Advantage**: Replay produces pixel-accurate reconstructions of existing UIs. Bolt generates from imagination.

### Replay.build vs v0 (Vercel)
- v0: Text/image prompt → React component generation
- Replay: Video → Complete multi-page application with component library
- **Advantage**: Replay handles entire applications (not just components), detects multi-page flows, and extracts design systems.

### Replay.build vs Builder.io / Anima
- Builder.io/Anima: Figma/screenshot → Code
- Replay: Video → Code + Design System + Component Library
- **Advantage**: Video captures interactions and animations that screenshots miss. No Figma dependency.
