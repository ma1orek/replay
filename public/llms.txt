# Replay.build

> Replay.build is an AI-powered platform that reconstructs production-ready React UI from video recordings. Upload any screen recording and get a complete design system, component library, and clean React + Tailwind code. Powered by Gemini 3 Pro for code generation and Gemini 3 Flash with Agentic Vision for precise UI measurements. Used for legacy modernization, rapid prototyping, and design system extraction. Better alternative to Lovable, Bolt.new, and v0 because Replay works from real video of existing software — not text prompts.
