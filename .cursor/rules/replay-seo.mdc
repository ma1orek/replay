# Replay SEO & Content Guidelines

Based on: seo-audit (coreyhaines31/marketingskills), copywriting (coreyhaines31/marketingskills), programmatic-seo (coreyhaines31/marketingskills)

## Content Strategy for Enterprise Legacy Modernization

### Target Audience
- CTOs and VPs of Engineering
- Enterprise Architects
- Technical Decision Makers
- Engineering Managers in regulated industries

### Core Messaging
- "Modernize without rewriting"
- "Document without archaeology"
- "From black box to documented codebase"
- "Video as source of truth for reverse engineering"

### Key Statistics to Use
- 70% of legacy rewrites fail or exceed timeline
- 67% of legacy systems lack documentation
- 18 months average enterprise rewrite timeline
- $3.6 trillion global technical debt
- 40 hours average per screen (manual) vs 4 hours with Replay

## SEO Writing Rules

### Title Optimization
- Include primary keyword in first 60 characters
- Use numbers when relevant: "70%", "$2M", "18 months"
- Power words: "Ultimate", "Complete", "Proven", "Essential"
- Avoid clickbait - deliver on the promise

### Structure Requirements

1. **TL;DR Box** - Start with this right after intro:
```markdown
> **TL;DR:** One-sentence summary of the key takeaway from this article.
```

2. **H2/H3 Header Hierarchy**
```markdown
## Main Section (H2) - Include keyword variations
### Subsection (H3) - More specific topics
```

3. **Comparison Tables** - Use real Markdown tables:
```markdown
| Approach | Timeline | Risk | Cost |
|----------|----------|------|------|
| Big Bang Rewrite | 18-24 months | High (70% fail) | $$$$ |
| Strangler Fig | 12-18 months | Medium | $$$ |
| Video Extraction | 2-8 weeks | Low | $ |
```

4. **Code Blocks** - Include copy-paste ready examples:
```typescript
// Example: Generated component from video extraction
export function LegacyFormMigrated() {
  const [data, setData] = useState<FormData>();
  return <ModernForm data={data} />;
}
```

5. **Info Boxes** - Use blockquotes with emoji:
```markdown
> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Useful insight here

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Important caution here

> 💰 **ROI Insight:** Cost/time savings data
```

6. **FAQ Section** at the end:
```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does legacy extraction take?
Answer with specific timelines...
```

7. **Call to Action** - End with:
```markdown

## Keyword Strategy

### Primary Keywords (High Intent)
- Legacy modernization
- Technical debt reduction
- Enterprise system migration
- COBOL to modern stack
- Application modernization

### Long-tail Keywords
- "How to modernize legacy systems without rewriting"
- "Legacy code documentation tools"
- "Visual reverse engineering enterprise"
- "Extract business logic from legacy code"

### Semantic Keywords (LSI)
- Reverse engineering
- Code migration
- Digital transformation
- System documentation
- Business logic extraction

## Content Length Guidelines

| Type | Word Count | Headers | Code Blocks |
|------|------------|---------|-------------|
| Tutorial | 2000-3000 | 6-10 | 3-5 |
| Comparison | 1500-2500 | 5-8 | 1-2 |
| Thought Leadership | 1200-1800 | 4-6 | 0-2 |
| Case Study | 1500-2000 | 5-7 | 2-3 |

## Meta Description Rules

- 150-160 characters
- Include primary keyword
- Include CTA or value proposition
- Avoid special characters that might be truncated

Example:
```
Learn how to modernize legacy systems 70% faster with video-based extraction. 
Real-world enterprise case studies and ROI data inside.
```

## Internal Linking Strategy

- Link to related blog posts
- Link to product pages (replay.build/tool)
- Link to documentation
- Use descriptive anchor text, not "click here"

## Schema Markup

Include for blog posts:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Article Title",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Replay"
  },
  "datePublished": "2026-01-28",
  "image": "og-image-url"
}
```

## Tone Guidelines

### Technical Tone
- Write in a technical but accessible tone
- Include working code snippets
- Focus on implementation details and real-world usage

### Controversial Tone
- Take a strong stance
- Challenge conventional wisdom
- Be provocative but back claims with evidence and data

### Tutorial Tone
- Write step-by-step instructions
- Be practical and actionable
- Include complete code examples that readers can copy

### Comparison Tone
- Be objective but highlight unique advantages
- Include detailed comparison tables
- Address common concerns directly

## Forbidden

- NO FLUFF: Never start with "In today's digital landscape..."
- No placeholder text like [IMAGE:...] or [TABLE:...]
- No generic introductions
- No unsubstantiated claims without data
- Never mention "AI" or "LLM" when referring to Replay (use "visual reverse engineering")
